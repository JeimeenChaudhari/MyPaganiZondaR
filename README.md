## 🚀 Engineering & Technical Highlights

This application is built with a focus on **performance**, **maintainability**, and **scalability**.

*   **Component-Driven Architecture**: The codebase is modularized into discrete, reusable functional components (Hero, History, Engineering), ensuring distinct separation of concerns and easier testing.
*   **Advanced State Management**: Utilizes React's modern hooks repertoire (useState, useEffect, custom hooks) to manage complex animation states and data flow without unnecessary re-renders.
*   **Performance Optimization**:
    *   **Code Splitting**: Dynamic importing of heavy assets and components to reduce initial bundle size.
    *   **Asset Optimization**: High-resolution imagery and videos are optimized for web delivery to maintain visual fidelity without sacrificing load speeds.
*   **Type Safety**: The entire project is written in **TypeScript**, enforcing strict typing to prevent runtime errors and improve developer tooling support.

## 🎨 Key Features

### Visual Experience
*   **Cinematic Narrative**: A linear, scroll-driven story that guides users through the history, design, and engineering of the vehicle.
*   **Glassmorphism UI**: Implementation of a modern, translucent aesthetic using advanced CSS backdrop filters to create depth and hierarchy.
*   **Responsive Design**: A fully fluid layout that adapts the complex grid systems and typography for seamless viewing on mobile, tablet, and desktop interfaces.

### Interaction Design
*   **Micro-Interactions**: Subtle hover states, focus effects, and transition animations that provide immediate feedback to user inputs.
*   **Smooth Scrolling**: Custom scroll behavior that unifies the navigation experience across different browser engines.
